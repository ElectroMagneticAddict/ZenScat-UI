# ZenScat-UI

2D RCWA and 2D FDFD for Guided Mode Resonance filters and Photonic Crystals.
The _main_ .mat files, functions and User Interface (UI) classes are in "ZenScat.zip" file that belong to the application.

The .py files are in the Data generation.zip file for generating permittivity arrays with their geometrical parameters, and are used for Casual Import application. Such files involve: Magnusson's spatial filter, Guided Mode Resonance filters, Bragg coupler with top grating for enhancing Laser Induced Damage Threshold.

Distributed Feedback (DFB) system permittivity value initialization files are used for optimization, which are also generated from .py main file. Optimization is performed in order to maximize gain/absorption of the materials.

Please check APP_TUTORIAL.pdf for the UI nuances before using the application.

# Getting started
The ZenScat is in possession of five UI classes - 
1. Opening app class
2. Casual app class
3. Casual import app class
4. Optimization (Casual + Import) app class
5. 2D Finite Difference Frequency Domain application class
